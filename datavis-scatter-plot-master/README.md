# Build a Scatter Plot
See the [lab webpage](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~curtsinger/teaching/2017S/CSC395/labs/08.scatter-plot.html) for detailed instructions on this lab.

If you use Chrome, you must load the page from a web server instead of just opening the file directly on your machine. To do this, run the following command in a terminal from the directory that contains your lab code:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Once the program has started up, launch a web browser and go to <http://localhost:8000/lab.html> to load the lab's main page.
